Intro
My portfolio example it is a portfolio page. it has home nav links and files :
•	about 
•	projects 
•	and contacts file. 
it helps to see the structure of such sample page and  the user to check its responsiveness. it is also open to adjustments such as: changing px to em measurement units  and scale down the font-size of headers and images.  
Features:
It implements css pseudo code, css animation and transitions and css grid and flexbox. Also it uses  root css Var. 

Issues; 
it still has an issue with fixed header. The latter will become full and overflow the other layouts.
